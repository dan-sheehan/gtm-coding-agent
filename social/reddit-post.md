**Title:** I replaced most of my GTM tool stack with a coding agent and Python scripts. Open-sourcing the system.

**Body:**

I was an SDR who manually built buying committees in Salesforce and sent 200+ cold emails a day. Now I build GTM systems with coding agents.

Over the past year I moved most of my outbound, enrichment, ICP research, and content creation out of SaaS tools and into a structured workspace that an AI coding agent (Claude Code) operates from. The setup is markdown files for context, Python scripts for automation, and SQLite for local data. Total monthly cost dropped from ~$2K to under $200 (mostly API calls).

I packaged the whole system into an open-source starter kit: **GTM Coding Agent Starter Kit**

What's in it:

- An interactive CLAUDE.md that onboards you when you open it in Claude Code. It asks about your GTM, recommends a setup, builds your workspace.
- 10 educational chapters covering everything from "what is a coding agent" to "run your Mac as a GTM server"
- A full GTM-OS skeleton (ICP, positioning, competitors, segments, campaigns)
- 4 mode configs (solo founder, agency, single-client, ABM outbound)
- Templates for CLAUDE.md files, voice DNA, content formats, partner structures
- Ready-to-use prompts for ICP building, positioning, competitor analysis, email sequences
- Python script skeletons for enrichment and research pipelines
- Anonymized worked examples

The key idea: instead of configuring SaaS dashboards, you build a workspace of structured files. A coding agent reads those files and becomes your GTM co-pilot. Your ICP, positioning, voice, and tooling all live in markdown. The agent references them when writing outbound, creating content, or building lists.

This isn't a no-code tool. You'll learn how context engineering works, how to connect tools via API, and how to write scripts that automate your pipeline. The chapters are educational, not just docs.

Who it's for:
- Founders doing their own GTM
- GTM engineers and rev ops people
- Agencies running GTM for clients
- Anyone curious about using coding agents for work that isn't software engineering

Who it's NOT for:
- People who want a pre-built product
- Teams with established enterprise tooling that works
- Anyone looking for a no-code solution

Happy to answer questions about the system, the approach, or specific GTM workflows I've automated.

Built with Claude Code. The whole repo was built by a coding agent operating from a structured plan. Meta.

**Notes for posting:**
- Post to r/ClaudeAI first (most receptive to the tooling angle)
- r/sales second (lead with the SDR backstory and cost savings)
- r/SaaS third (lead with the build-vs-buy angle)
- Reply to every comment in the first 2 hours
- Don't be defensive if people push back on "replacing tools"
